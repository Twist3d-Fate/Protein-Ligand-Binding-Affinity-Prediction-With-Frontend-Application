üî¨ Scientific Background
- This application demonstrates the use of Graph Neural Networks for drug discovery applications. The GNN processes molecular structures as graphs, where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges, allowing for sophisticated analysis of molecular properties and their relationship to biological activity.

Key Concepts:

- Binding Affinity: Measure of interaction strength between protein and ligand
- SMILES: Simplified molecular-input line-entry system for chemical notation
- PDB: Protein Data Bank format for 3D molecular structures
- Graph Convolution: Neural network operation on graph-structured data
  
For more information on the underlying science, refer to recent literature on graph neural networks in drug discovery and molecular property prediction.
